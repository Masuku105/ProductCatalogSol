‚úÖ SOLID / OOP & Design Patterns
Dependency Injection throughout (IProductService, IProductRepository)

Single Responsibility Principle: Controllers only handle request flow; service logic is in service layer.

Open‚ÄëClosed & Dependency Inversion: Interfaces allow substituting mocks or new implementations.

Repository Pattern encapsulates API calls, hiding HTTP logic from higher layers.

This solution showcases:

Clean, well-layered architecture

Good use of SOLID principles, OOP, and standard design patterns

Efficient caching strategy, leveraging decorator/proxy and read-through implementations

Full local development setup and test coverage
